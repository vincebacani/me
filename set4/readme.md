TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
16:42 after attempting pair programming, I was able to finish exercise one from set 3, hearing an outsider is very helpful LMAO its like when you read out and essay to hear if it makes sense.

however, set 5 is difficult and I quickly lost where I was and what I should do.
